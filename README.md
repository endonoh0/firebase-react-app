# Winged It

Wingin’ it here. Why waste your time thinking about what you should make to eat when you could just wing it? If you wing it, we provide you a flexible and customize experience for planning your meal rather than guessing what you need. Simply look in your fridge and type in your ingredients. 

This is our final project for the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp where we build an application from the ground up.

- **Testing:** Storybook, Katalon
- **Front-End:** React, Sass, Boostrap, MapBox, Material UI, Framer Motion, iFrame
- **Back-End:** Node, Firestore
